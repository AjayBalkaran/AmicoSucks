# pipelineCheatsheet
This is a cheat sheet that will help calculate the various discounts we are often asked for. 
The purpose of this is to be able to quickly provide a correct answer rather than fumble around in SAP or having to do the math needed every time.  This project will constantly be updated as more and more math problems occur at our job.  The goal is to be a one stop shop  that will help us be more productive in our day to day operations.
